Hereâ€™s a list of all the prompts you've submitted so far:

1. **"Are you capable of understanding a plain text patch file?"**
2. **"I'd like to start a new project. Let's start a web server with
   Go lang. Provide me some starter code for this web server. Provide
   the contents of any of the files with full comments. Put any
   summary or explanations in the code files and not in the
   chat. Let's start there."**
3. **"OK. Make a shell script to build and then run the new server."**
4. **"OK. I've added these files as main.go and run.sh respectively to
   a directory."**
5. **"Thank you I did do that."**
6. **"Create a markdown readme.md file documenting the project
   developer experience so far."**
7. **"Create a .gitignore file for this project that makes sense"**
8. **"Seems like the .gitignore file should avoid adding the output
   binary. Right?"**
9. **"OK, write a text file for a git commit for the work we've done
   so far. Also, provide me with the git command to run that passes
   the file with the git commit message."**
10. **"Seems like I should add the files to git stage first."**
11. **"I've named the file msg-00001 and put it in commits/
    directory. Please update the command."**
12. **"Provide me with a list of all the prompts I've submitted so
