Hereâ€™s a list of all the prompts you've submitted so far in this run:

1. **"I've made the run.sh executable so in the readme it doesn't need to include this instruction. Revise the readme.md."**  
2. **"Let's add a self-signed cert for TLS to the server."**  
3. **"OK so running the openssl command created server.crt and server.key. Those should be added to the repo?"**  
4. **"Right please provide me with the updated .gitignore so I can replace the whole thing."**  
5. **"Thank you."**  
6. **"It looks like starting the web server doesn't use these files. We should update the code?"**  
7. **"How should I test that the updated TLS server is working?"**  
8. **"Great let's write a quick markdown file with these steps for testing the updated server. I'll put it in a file called commits/basic-testing-0002.md"**  
9. **"Actually, I put the file in a commits/basic-testing-0002.md. Thanks for writing it."**  
10. **"Provide me with a list of all the prompts I've submitted so far in this run of prompts. I'm going to make a file with them called commits/prompts-0002.md."**  

Would you like me to format it into a markdown file for
`commits/prompts-0002.md`? ðŸš€
